# EUC Profile Buddy

Windows application to automate the maintenance of your End User Computing (EUC) user profiles directly from the system tray or the command line. Includes user and admin options to effectively manage profile size, settings, backup and more.

Gives you as a user or administrator the ability to check on profile size and data usage along with clearing out unused files and folders. It will also allow you to perform common tasks on the profile to stop the need for that call to support to resolve issues. There is a profile detail screen to show the configuration settings in place driving the profile solution.
